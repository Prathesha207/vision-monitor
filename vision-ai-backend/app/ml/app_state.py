"""
app_state.py - shared in-process state that coordinates GPU access between
your live inference service and the training subprocess.

Import this SAME module from both your inference code and training_service.py
(they must live in the same FastAPI process for this in-memory lock to work --
which they will, since only train.py/prepare_dataset.py itself run as a
separate OS process, not the FastAPI app).

Why this exists: a consumer GPU can't do 30fps live inference and YOLO
training at the same time without one starving the other (or crashing with
CUDA OOM). Before starting a training job, the router calls
try_enter_training(); if it returns False, training is refused (409) rather
than silently fighting inference for VRAM.

NEW: the same problem exists BETWEEN the two inference paths -- a video
upload session and a live camera session can each load their own
DuckAnalyzer (their own YOLO model instance) into VRAM at the same time,
with nothing stopping it. active_inference_kind tracks which *kind* of
inference currently owns the GPU ("video" or "camera"). Multiple sessions
of the SAME kind are still allowed to overlap (that's existing, intentional
behavior on both sides) -- only a kind MISMATCH is rejected. A ref-count
tracks how many sessions of that kind are currently active so the owner
resets to None only once the last one exits.
